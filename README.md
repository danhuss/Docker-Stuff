# Docker-Stuff
Some of my random docker stuff that I've come up with playing around with docker.

- Scripts - Various docker related scripts (Bash and PowerShell)
  - Pull-All-Images - Bash and PowerShell to pull an update for all currently downloaded images and tags.
- Stacks - Stack files for docker swarm stuff.
